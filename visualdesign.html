  <p> Purple and pink are my favorite colors and that’s why it’s the dominant palette in this piece. These are my favorite tv shows which are animated because as a kid I didn’t get the chance to watch many cartoons so I use that time now to make that up. Astrology is also a passion of mine and that’s why there’s an astronomical element to the work.</p>
  <h3> "Fawn" </h3>
    <img src="visual design media/pixel character.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>
  <p> I’ve always loved fantasy, the ability to immerse myself in another dimension gave me hope whenever I was down. Unfortunately, in these stories and games that I’ve connected with there was still the distance between the characters and how they never looked like me. I want to be a creator but that doesn’t mean diminishing important aspects of the world, myself, and my communities. A dystopian world based on the oppression of my people will never understand the real power struggle. That being said, that is not what it is all about, black girls should always have the opportunity to see themselves as a hero and not a side character. Fawn is an elf in a forest and is on the way to save the wilting flowers and the muddy waters of their home. In order to do so, they will use the help of what’s been around them since the beginning, nature. The flora and fauna will lead the way for them, as long as their heart is in the right place. </p>
